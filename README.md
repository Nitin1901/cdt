# Cheating Detection System

Developed a groundbreaking software project as a final project for my course that revolutionizes the integrity and security of online exams, elevating standards while alleviating the burden on teachers. The primary objective is to create a cutting-edge cheating detection system that not only confirms the identity of students but also monitors their activities through a webcam, ensuring the highest level of exam integrity. The software also allows for automatic parsing of questions and answers. This transformative software garnered significant attention and recognition for its innovative approach. Esteemed judges, renowned for their expertise in the field, expressed profound interest and enthusiasm for the project, further validating its exceptional quality and potential.
